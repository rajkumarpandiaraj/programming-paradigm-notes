                                FUNCTIONAL VS OOP VS PROCEDURAL

What is "programming Paradigms"?
        -> How we write/organize our code is called programming Paradigms.

How may types of programming Paradigms are there?
        There are the types. They are 
            1.Object-Oriented
            2.Procedural 
            3.Functional 

Object-Oriented Programming :
        -> organize data and logic in Objects(properties + methods)
        -> organize code in logical entities

Procedural Programming :
        -> Write Sequential series of execution of steps/tasks
        -> 'Top to bottom' code execution
        -> every programming has this property.

Functional Programming :
        -> Organize code in (pure if possible) functions with clearly defined tasks.
        -> Pass data around via parameters.
